## Introduction
Talk.ink is an alternative to:
- Gmail
- Slack
- Twist

it's an open source communication tools that can be used to manage work as simple as manage thread with the ability to open/close it.

## Getting Started

**Frontend**
Talk.ink is using React and Tailwind Css as the Front-end engine. To get started, first you should install NodeJs in your machine

```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```
then clone this project and simply run

```
$ npm install
```

**Backend**
Talk.ink is using Kontenbase (www.kontenbase.com) as a No Code back-end engine. For now you can access the public back-end endpoint here:

```
https://api.kontenbase.com/query/api/v1/d289610c-ebf7-4fbb-8576-31a568f184fd
```
We'll open sourced it later, just be patient :D
